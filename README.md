# Bank-Loan-Analysis

### 📊 Overview
This project presents a complete **end-to-end data analytics pipeline** for analyzing **bank loan performance and customer trends**.  
The goal was to take raw loan data from initial extraction all the way to powerful, interactive visualizations.

---

### 🧠 Objectives
- Understand key loan metrics: funded amount, received amount, DTI ratio, and interest rate.  
- Analyze good vs. bad loans, monthly trends, and borrower behavior.  
- Compare **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Previous Month-to-Date (MoM)** performance.  
- Build **interactive dashboards** in Excel, Power BI and Tableau to compare strengths and visualization styles.
